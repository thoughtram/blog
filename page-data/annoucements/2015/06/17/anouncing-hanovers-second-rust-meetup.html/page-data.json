The meetup was quite a success and ever since then we’ve been asked a lot about a revival.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t heard about Rust yet here comes a little spoiler.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.rust-lang.org\">Rust</a> website:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes*, and eliminates data races</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What makes this language different from any other language is that it aims to provide memory safety without sacrificing performance. It provides modern features like <strong>pattern matching</strong>, <strong>generics</strong>, <strong>traits</strong> etc. while at the same time it’s aimed to eventually replace C/C++.</p>\n<p>Imagine a world where system programming becomes approachable for the rest of us!</p>\n<p><strong>Today we are happy to announce the second Rust meetup in Hanover.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are the facts:</p>\n<p><strong>When:</strong> June 23rd 2015, 19:00<br><strong>Where:</strong> Schwarzer Bär 2, 30449 Hannover</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2436.1248568616866!2d9.720608999999996!3d52.36815600000001!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x47b074bfe13224df%3A0x9f4e6470096cf0ce!2sEDELSTALL+GmbH+-+Coworking+Space+Hannover!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1434552023523\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Schedule:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Christoph will give a talk about Rust</li>\n<li>We will have an open discussion about all things Rust</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t worry if you don’t have any prior knowledge in system programming languages like C or C++.
