Starting with our very first <a href=\"/announcements/2014/06/23/announcing-our-first-workshop.html\">Git Master Class</a>, followed by organizing <a href=\"/announcements/meetups/2014/06/24/organizing-hannovers-first-rust-meetup.html\">local developer meetups</a> and later countless training sessions to <a href=\"/announcements/2016/08/30/announcing-angular-2-master-class-in-nyc.html\">master Angular</a>, which were then extended with <a href=\"/announcements/2018/04/12/rxjs-master-class-and-courseware-updates.html\">more advanced classes</a>.</p>\n<p>We are extremely grateful that we’ve had the opportunity to see the world, learn about different cultures, meet many amazing people of which a lot became our friends, and ultimately experience a journey that has shaped us as humans, for the better. And all of this, thanks to you. Thanks to everyone who helped making our events happen, whether you’ve helped organizing one or travelled the long way to be part of the experience. Thanks to everyone who’s cheered us on. Thanks to everyone that we had the pleasure to learn from. Thanks to everyone who joined the squad to help others levelling up.</p>\n<p><strong>You know who you are.</strong></p>\n<p>We proudly look back at many years of fun and challenges, and we take these memories along with us as we’re continuing to explore new paths in our lifes and hopefully grow further. </p>\n<p>It’s been an amazing ride, but now it’s time to say <em>so long, and thanks for all the fish</em>.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":"pascal_precht","title":"Farewell","imageUrl":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/241d45d356d4956215a3771226e7e383/30037/we-are-thoughtram.jpg","srcSet":"/static/241d45d356d4956215a3771226e7e383/10bdc/we-are-thoughtram.jpg 158w,\n/static/241d45d356d4956215a3771226e7e383/f4ab0/we-are-thoughtram.jpg 315w,\n/static/241d45d356d4956215a3771226e7e383/30037/we-are-thoughtram.jpg 630w,\n/static/241d45d356d4956215a3771226e7e383/9810d/we-are-thoughtram.jpg 945w,\n/static/241d45d356d4956215a3771226e7e383/ff2e4/we-are-thoughtram.jpg 1260w,\n/static/241d45d356d4956215a3771226e7e383/989b1/we-are-thoughtram.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"}}},"date":"13 February 2024","summary":"thoughtram says goodbye.
