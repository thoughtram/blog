It’s the first part of the entire Angular 2 Master Class experience and we will spend <strong>one full day</strong> building our first Angular 2 application, touching the most important parts of the framework.</p>\n<p>We are going to learn…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how to bootstrap an application and display data.</li>\n<li>how to create and inject services using the new Dependency Injection.</li>\n<li>how to perform http calls using the revamped http layer based on observables.</li>\n<li>how to implement basic routing using the new component router.</li>\n<li>how to create simple forms that take advantage of two-way data binding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After this training we’ve built an Angular 2 application covering all the learnings we gained throughout the day. </p>\n<p><strong>Who is this training for?</strong><br>\nAngular 2 is in beta and most of the APIs are stable, however, things are still moving. This training is for absolute beginners as well as experienced developers coming from the AngularJS world, who can’t wait to get their feet wet with the next version of the framework.</p>\n<p><strong>What you will take home</strong><br>\nAs an Angular 2 Master Class attendee you’ll get <strong>life-long access</strong> to all current and future slide decks via our exclusive learning platform <em>classroom</em>.
