That said, the demand for our trainings keeps growing at a fast pace and we get requests from literally all around the world. Our trainings stand for high quality, up to date content spiced up with a very fun and casual style of presentation.</p>\n<p>We see it as our mission to deliver the best experience we can. In order to keep the quality of our work very high we pick the people we want to work with very carefully.</p>\n<h2>Meet Dominic</h2>\n<p>We‚Äôve first met Dominic almost two years ago as an attendee of one of our classes on Angular 1.x. Since then, we‚Äôve seen him growing into a very passionate and skilled member of the Angular community. He‚Äôs also tons of fun and we love hanging out with him. üéâ</p>\n<p>People keep asking if his last name ‚ÄúElm‚Äù is real or if he‚Äôs just a big fan of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm_(programming_language)\">Elm programming language</a>. We think the reality is that Elm took a lot of inspiration from Dominics last name!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 800px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4dc6035deb37afc7cf89603612a170b6/b3ee8/dominic.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"dominic\"\n        title=\"dominic\"\n        src=\"/static/4dc6035deb37afc7cf89603612a170b6/a296c/dominic.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4dc6035deb37afc7cf89603612a170b6/f544b/dominic.jpg 200w,\n/static/4dc6035deb37afc7cf89603612a170b6/41689/dominic.jpg 400w,\n/static/4dc6035deb37afc7cf89603612a170b6/a296c/dominic.jpg 800w,\n/static/4dc6035deb37afc7cf89603612a170b6/b3ee8/dominic.jpg 960w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Over the last couple of months we‚Äôve had the chance to closely work with Dominic and co-run trainings with him all across Europe.</p>\n<p>Today we are very happy to announce that Dominic officially joins our team to work with us.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôd like to see Dominic in action go and grab your ticket either for our upcoming <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.de/e/angular-master-class-freiburg-tickets-31634972053\">Angular Master Class Freiburg</a> or for and in-depth  workshop on forms at <a href=\"https://www.ng-conf.org/sessions/taming-forms-angular/\">ng-conf</a> in Salt Lake City.</p>\n<h2>More courseware, trainings and articles</h2>\n<p>We are proud to have Dominic on our team and look forward to the things we will achieve together.
