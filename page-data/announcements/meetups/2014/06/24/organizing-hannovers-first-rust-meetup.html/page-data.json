Not for money, but for fun!</p>\n<p>One of those new exciting technologies is a language called <a href=\"http://www.rust-lang.org\">Rust</a> developed entirely in the open by the popular browser company Mozilla.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.rust-lang.org\">Rust</a> website:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes*, and eliminates data races</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What makes this language different from any other language is that it aims to provide memory safety without sacrificing performance. It provides modern features like <strong>pattern matching</strong>, <strong>generics</strong>, <strong>traits</strong> etc. while at the same time it’s aimed to eventually replace C/C++. </p>\n<p>Imagine a world where system programming becomes approachable for the rest of us!</p>\n<p><strong>Today we are happy to announce the very first Rust meetup in Hanover.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are the facts:</p>\n<p><strong>When:</strong> July 10th 2014, 18:30<br><strong>Where:</strong> CouchCommerce GmbH, Bödekerstraße 56, 30161 Hannover </p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d2435.189167043073!2d9.752235!3d52.385121000000005!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x47b074b7564267af%3A0xd9c555e4f36d6a25!2sCouchCommerce+GmbH!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1403607912344\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0\"></iframe>\n<p><strong>Schedule:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Christoph will give a lightning talk about <a href=\"http://www.rust-lang.org\">Rust</a> introducing it’s core concepts</li>\n<li>We will look at the web framework <a href=\"http://floor-org.github.io/floor/\">floor</a> that Christoph started implementing in Rust</li>\n<li>The plan is to turn every participant into a <a href=\"http://floor-org.github.io/floor/\">floor</a> contributor by the end of the session :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t worry if you don’t have any prior knowledge in system programming languages like C or C++.
