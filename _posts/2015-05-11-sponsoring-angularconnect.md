Today we are very happy to announce that we're going to sponsor [AngularConnect](http://angularconnect.com), the official Angular conference in Europe, taking place on the 20th and 21st October in London this year. Not only that you can find us during the conference, **we're  also going to run a workshop the day before** to help you getting started with Angular and being perfectly prepared for the event.

The workshop will be a single-day training on the 19th October and mostly cover the first part of our [Angular Master Class](http://thoughtram.io/angular-master-class.html). However, we're very flexible in interchanging specific topics, so you as an attendee get to learn what you want to learn! If you're interested in attending AngularConnect, head over to their website and make sure to get a ticket.

We are looking very forward to meeting you there at both, the workshop and the conference!
