It's on! You can now buy the first bunch of tickets for our Git Ninja Class workshop happening on the **6th + 7th of September** in Hannover, Germany!

## What is this workshop about?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It’s invention was a blessing to the whole software world. However, it takes a bit of training to become really productive. Now is the best time to level up to become a real git Ninja!

## What you will learn

We split the workshop in two days. The first day should get you started to get on an intermediate level. 

The second day will teach you all the ins and outs of git to become really productive. For the second day to attend it is important to be on an intermediate level already. That doesn't mean that you have to attend the first day as a precondition for the second day. If you feel that you have the skills already it will be fine to only attend the second day but you'll get the most out of it if you attend both days. 

Take a look at the [detailed workshop description](http://thoughtram.io/#trainings) to get a feel for the covered topics.

##Why take this training?

- This course will make you more productive
- It will save you lots of time and money. Every day.
- You'll get **a six month micro plan for github.com**
- You get the chance to meet our special guest **Mike Adolphs** from GitHub
