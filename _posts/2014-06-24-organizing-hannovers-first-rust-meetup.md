As thoughtram we are dedicated to invest into interesting new technologies that we feel are exciting and have the potential to become popular. Not for money, but for fun!

One of those new exciting technologies is a language called [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) developed entirely in the open by the popular browser company Mozilla.

From the [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) website:

>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes*, and eliminates data races

What makes this language different from any other language is that it aims to provide memory safety without sacrificing performance. It provides modern features like **pattern matching**, **generics**, **traits** etc. while at the same time it's aimed to eventually replace C/C++. 

Imagine a world where system programming becomes approachable for the rest of us!

**Today we are happy to announce the very first Rust meetup in Hanover.**

Here are the facts:

**When:** July 10th 2014, 18:30<br>**Where:** CouchCommerce GmbH, Bödekerstraße 56, 30161 Hannover

**Schedule:**

* Christoph will give a lightning talk about [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) introducing it's core concepts
* We will look at the web framework [floor](http://floor-org.github.io/floor/) that Christoph started implementing in Rust
* The plan is to turn every participant into a [floor](http://floor-org.github.io/floor/) contributor by the end of the session :)

Don't worry if you don't have any prior knowledge in system programming languages like C or C++. We are all beginners. That said, if you do have knowledge in system programming languages, we definitely want you to attend, too! **Don't be late**, we might have Rust stickers for you :)

We like to take the chance to thank [CouchCommerce](http://couchcommerce.com) for sponsoring the venue and drinks!
