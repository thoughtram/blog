It's been roughly a year ago that we organized the very first [Rust meetup in Hanover](http://blog.thoughtram.io/announcements/rust/meetups/2014/06/24/organizing-hannovers-first-rust-meetup.html). The meetup was quite a success and ever since then we've been asked a lot about a revival.

If you haven't heard about Rust yet here comes a little spoiler.

From the [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) website:

>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes*, and eliminates data races

What makes this language different from any other language is that it aims to provide memory safety without sacrificing performance. It provides modern features like **pattern matching**, **generics**, **traits** etc. while at the same time it's aimed to eventually replace C/C++.

Imagine a world where system programming becomes approachable for the rest of us!

**Today we are happy to announce the second Rust meetup in Hanover.**

Here are the facts:

**When:** June 23rd 2015, 19:00<br>**Where:** Schwarzer BÃ¤r 2, 30449 Hannover

**Schedule:**

* Christoph will give a talk about Rust
* We will have an open discussion about all things Rust

Don't worry if you don't have any prior knowledge in system programming languages like C or C++. We are all beginners. That said, if you do have knowledge in system programming languages, we definitely want you to attend, too! **Don't be late**, we might have Rust stickers for you :)
