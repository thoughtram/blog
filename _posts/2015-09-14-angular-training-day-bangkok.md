Today we are happy to announce that we will run a free Angular Training Day in Bangkok on the 29th of October.

When we've [been to Bangkok](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angularjs/2015/02/21/around-the-globe.html) in April this year to give talks about Angular and Rust we were overwhelmed by the kindness of the local tech community.

We made a promise to come back later this year to spend an entire day teaching Angular. Here we are making our promise a reality with our **free** Angular Training Day.

## Schedule

We don't have a fixed schedule. We have material to teach a whole week about Angular 1 and 2. Including lots of slides, running examples and exercises. Unfortunately there really is just this single day available for this event. We will let **you** drive our schedule. No matter if you are a beginner or a proficient Angular developer, we'll try to make this event both fun and beneficial for all of you.

## When & Where

**When:** 29th of October 2015 from 10 am to 5 pm<br>
**Where:** Growth cafe & co., Siam Square Soi 2, Bangkok, Thailand
