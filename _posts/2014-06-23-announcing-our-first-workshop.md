As announced [earlier this month](/posts/we-are-thoughtram), we were working on our website to launch it as soon as possible. The time has come!

We finally launched our brand new website at [thoughtram.io](http://thoughtram.io) and we are excited to announce our very first workshop: 

## Git Ninja Class!

Have you ever wondered what the heck the HEAD is? And do you know how to properly do an interactive rebase without screwing everything up? And if you screwed it up, do you know how to restore things? Don't worry, you'll learn all this in this course. This course will make your average workday more productive. Every. Single. Day.

For more information, head over to [thoughtram.io](http://thoughtram.io) and save the date, because the first bunch of tickets will be available very soon!
