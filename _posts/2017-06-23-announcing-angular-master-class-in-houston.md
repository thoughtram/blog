While we just [returned from Denmark](/announcements/2017/05/05/announcing-angular-master-class-in-denmark.html) and announced another upcoming [Angular Master Class in Berlin](/announcements/2017/06/23/announcing-angular-master-class-in-berlin.html), we know that people want us to run our training all around the world.

It's been a couple of month since we've last run our training in the US so we are very pleased to announce that our **Angular Master Class is coming to Houston in August!**

We've found the perfect, artsy venue to get into the right piece of mind to learn Angular in and out.

The event takes place on the **22nd to 25th August 2017** in the **Bisong Art Gallery**.

This is the first time we'll run a 4-day training. The reason we added another day is because we want to teach our brand new material on  **Redux and ngrx**. Join us for a couple of days of learning and fun including things like

- Components and Modules
- Fetching data using Http
- Advanced Dependency Injection
- Basic Forms
- Observables deep-dive
- Architectural patterns
- ContentChildren and ViewChildren
- Template-driven Forms
- Reactive Forms
- Observables deep-dive
- Children routes and lazy-loading
- **Redux and ngrx**

...and many more!
