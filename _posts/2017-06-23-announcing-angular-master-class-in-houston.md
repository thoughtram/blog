It's been a couple of month since we've last run our training in the US so we are very pleased to announce that our **Angular Master Class is coming to Houston in August!**

 We've found the perfect, artsy venue to get into the right piece of mind to learn Angular in and out. The event takes place on the **22nd to 25th August 2017** in the **Bisong Art Gallery**.

This is the ONLY public training thoughtram will provide [in Texas] for at least the next 12 months... so do not miss this opportunity.

You or your team can attend our public 3­-day or 4­-day training.

● Day 1: Jump Start with full, high­level introduction to Angular
● Day 2: Observables & Component Architecture
● Day 3: Routing & Forms
● Day 4: Redux + ngrx ­with immutable, 1­-way dataflows and reactive programming

> If you would like private, onsite training for a team of 10 or more developers, please contact us at training@thoughtram.io.

This is the first time we'll run a 4-day training. 

The reason we added another day is because we want to teach our brand new material on  **Redux and ngrx**. Join us for a couple of days of learning and fun including things like

These are intense, full 8­-hour days... but don't worry, we make the
classroom fun.

thoughtram provides two (2) trainers. Students work with hands­-on lab
exercises almost every 30 minutes. 

And we have social time after class on Day 2 and Day 4... for networking, offline questions, and simply relaxing with fellow Angular­-philes. We invite you to attend this public training and expand your Angular community network

Come to our training... have a blast and get the best acceleration into Angular possible.
