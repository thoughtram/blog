As recently [posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thoughtram/posts/706056426199788), we have some very exciting news to share with you today:

**We are super happy and excited to announce, that we'll bring our Angular 2 Master Class to the beautiful city of New York!**

<a href="https://www.eventbrite.de/e/angular-2-master-class-new-york-city-tickets-27384912009?ref=etckt" title="A2MC Eventbrite page"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/210413/18093557/e2f300ec-6e95-11e6-8d80-a573433ac27e.jpg" alt="Event Banner"></a>

The event takes place on the **14th to 16th November** and we'll announce the exact location very soon. Wait, 3 days? Yes! With this Angular 2 Master Class in New York City, it'll be the first time, we'll offer an optional third training day, allowing us to cover even more topics on Angular 2! In just 3 days you will get more than 22 hours of hands-on, developer training for the Angular 2 platform. It's up to you if you want to get an awesome 2-day training experience, or if you want to go one step further and gain even more knowledge with the third day.

### **"Young-Minds"** Free Training

We have also decided to encourage and inspire the next generation of developers... we think of this as a pay-forward, investment for the future of Angular!

With our new A2MC Training Sponsorship, we will encourage teenagers to continue their exploration & skills development with Web app technologies and the Angular 2 platform.
There simply is no better way to quickly ramp up on Angular 2! 

Do you know a young teenager who has impressed you with their interest and beginner-skills in Web app development? Do you want to inspire them to continue their amazing journey with software development?

**For this training, we will give away three (3) FREE tickets to our Angular 2 Master Class.** Just tweet why you think your nominee should get a ticket! Mention that person's twitter handle or email in the tweet. Include hashtag [#A2MC_YoungMinds](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23A2MC_YoungMinds).

The nominee must be between at least 13 years old and younger than 18 years of age: high school students. And all candidates must be nominated by the Angular community.

For example:

>> "I nominate @SomeOne because she's the youngest Angular Material contributor **#A2MC_YoungMinds**"


For each of our future public trainings, we promise to continue this sponsorship program... to promote young minds and the Angular platform.
