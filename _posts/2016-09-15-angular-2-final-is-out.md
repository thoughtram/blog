Last night, one of the biggest announcement in the Angular history has happened. Brad Green announced that **Angular 2 Final is out**!

<img src="/images/a2-final-announcement.jpg" alt="Brad Green announcing Angular 2 final">

Even though it took about 2.5 years to reach this milestone, this is really just the start. There are plans to release the Angular Material implementation for Angular 2, broader support for server-side rendering, more guides and much much more. Head over to the [official blog](https://angularjs.blogspot.de/2016/09/angular2-final.html) to learn more about the future plans (**we're super excited that we made it into the list of contributors, next to all the great people who made Angular 2 happen**). Or, check out Juri's [great write-up](http://juristr.com/blog/2016/09/ng2-released/) of the event.

## Where to start?

Now that the core Angular 2 is considered stable, you might want to jump in and learn about it but aren't really sure where to start. There are many good resources like [the official docs](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/), or [Victor Savkin's articles](https://vsavkin.com/).

We've been writing about Angular 2 too, in fact, since over a year by now and **we have 30+ articles**. This can be a bit overwhelming, which is why we've created a little resource guide to get you started.
