This year, the very first Angular conference in Amsterdam took place and it was a huge success. The conference aims to be mainly driven by the community and focusses not only on technical, but also inspiring talks. Christoph and I have been part of it as speakers and we talked about [the best Angular yet](http://thoughtram.io/the-best-angular-yet/#/) which was really fun!

A couple of days ago, we announced the debut of the [Angular 2 Master Class: Jump Start](http://blog.thoughtram.io/announcements/2015/12/21/introducing-angular-2-master-class.html) in Berlin and guess what, we don't stop there. Today we're excited to announce that we're going to run our Angular 2 Master Class: Jump Start at [NG-NL 2016](http://www.ng-nl.org/)!

One day before the conference, we'll be building a complete application making you familiar with the most important concepts and APIs of the framework. Tickets are limited so if you want to join us, make sure to grab yours.

We're looking very forward to meeting all of you there, let's have a great time!

**We also wish everyone a very happy new year.**

Pascal & Christoph
