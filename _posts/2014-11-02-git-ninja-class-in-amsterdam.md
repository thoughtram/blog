Today we are very happy to announce that **we will bring our Git Ninja Class to Amsterdam** in the Netherlands! Join us for another exciting two-day workshop experience about the true power of the Git version control system.

The workshop takes place at the 15th and 16th January 2015 <s>in the wonderful rooms of [De Voorhoede](http://voorhoede.nl/)</s> at the wonderful <a href="http://www.razmataz.nl/">Razmataz</a> restaurant. Unfortunately there was a fire in the building where the workshop was supposed to be held, therefore we had to change the location. Here's an updated map:

Of course, this wouldn't be possible without a strong helping hand. With [De Voorhoede](http://voorhoede.nl/) we not only have a first class sponsor, but also a new friend to make future events possible. We are very happy and thankful being able to partner with people that are excited as we are.

Tickets are <s>already [on sale](http://www.eventbrite.de/e/git-ninja-class-amsterdam-tickets-14095519077?aff=eorg) and **until the end of November we offer a special ticket price** of 400,00 €; the regular price is 500,00 € so you better be fast</s> sold out!

You can find more information about the workshop [here](http://thoughtram.io/git-master-class.html).

See you in Amsterdam!
