If you are following the startup scene chances are you've heard about the [betahaus](http://betahaus.com) before. It's a popular co-working space with branches in Berlin, Hamburg, Barcelona and Sofia.

We're happy to announce to take part in the new [betahaus education](http://hamburg.betahaus.de/programm/education) program that aims to deliver various formats including sessions, workshops and even series around topics such as tech, startup and everything digital.

On **Friday 17th of July** we'll give a one day workshop on the popular [Angular](http://angularjs.org) framework at the [betahaus Hamburg](http://hamburg.betahaus.de/wie-ihr-uns-findet).
