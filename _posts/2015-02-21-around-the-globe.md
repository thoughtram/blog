If you've been following us for a while, you've probably noticed by now that we <3 to travel. Especially to run workshops and speak at tech events around the globe.

## Salt Lake City

Today we are excited to disclose that Pascal will fly over to the US to speak at [ng-conf](http://www.ng-conf.org/). It's the world's original Angular conference taking place on March 5th + 6th in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Pascal will co-present with [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) core team member [Chirayu](https://github.com/chirayuk). They'll be speaking about the new internationalization and localization support that is currently being worked on.

We are super happy about this and are very much looking forward to the event!


## Bangkok

Roughly a week ago Pascal and I talked about "The best Angular yet" at the [ng-nl](http://ng-nl.org) conference in Amsterdam. We are happy to share with you that we will bring this talk to Bangkok, Thailand on April 17th. I will present "The best Angular yet" alone since Pascal will be running a workshop in Switzerland then. Did I mention that we love traveling?

The talk will be given at the local Angular meetup in Bangkok. <s>We're still busy to find the perfect location for the meetup so stay tuned for updates regarding the exact location and time.</s>

The meetup will take place at the [Launchpad Co-working space](https://www.facebook.com/launchpadhq/info?tab=overview) and start at 4pm.
