Just recently, we wrote about how much we love to travel and making friends [around the globe](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angularjs/2015/02/21/around-the-globe.html). That's why we're making this part of our mission. In fact, I'm writing this post while I'm sitting in a hotel in Lugano, Switzerland. Today we'd like to give you information about the next upcoming events that we'll be running or attending to.

## More to come!

Even if that is already lot of dates to set your alarms for, we're not completely done with our planning for 2015 yet. There's a lot of interest in trainings specifically for testing Angular apps. Also, people are interested in Angular 2. We are working on it and will announce some more exciting things very soon.
