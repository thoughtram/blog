If you haven't had the chance to join us in Denmark you really missed out on a fun event! However, here are good news: **We are bringing our Angular Master Class to Berlin soon!**

We are happy to team up with **Westernacher Solutions AG** to run the training in a really cool atmosphere with lots of room to teach, learn and have fun!
